  <h1>Privacy Policy for Caption for Creators</h1>
  <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 08/29/2025</p>
  
  <p>Caption for Creators (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (“App”).</p>
  
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email, or contact details) from users.</p>
  <p>Our app may access:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microphone / Audio</strong> – only to process and generate captions from audio.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos / Videos</strong> – if you choose to upload or edit videos with captions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information stays on your device and is not stored or transmitted to our servers.</p>
  
  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Any audio, video, or captions you create are used solely within the app to provide the captioning feature. We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All processing is done locally on your device, unless you choose to export or share your video.</li>
    <li>We do not maintain a database of your personal content.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>If the app integrates third-party tools (such as analytics, crash reporting, or ads), these services may collect limited data as described in their own privacy policies.</p>
  <p>Examples may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple App Store services (for updates, purchases)</li>
    <li>Analytics providers (if enabled in future versions)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke microphone or photo/video access at any time through your device settings.</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app removes all content stored locally on your device.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the “Last Updated” date above.</p>
